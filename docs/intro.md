# Hey there! üëã

Welcome to the **Free Next Init boilerplate** documentation! üöÄ

This boilerplate is a starting point for your Next.js project, with a lot of features and configurations already set up for you. It's a great way to start a new project without having to worry about setting up all the configurations from scratch.

This project is **open-source** and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/raulcanodev/next-init). Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest new features.

Let's get started! üéâ

## Why Next Init? ü§î
I've been seeing many boilerplates these days, that are either too simple or too complex. This boilerplate is designed to be a middle ground, with just the right amount of features and configurations to get you started quickly.

I decided to make it free and open-source so that anyone can use it without worrying on costs.

You can either use this boilerplate as a starting point for your project or as a learning resource to see how a full-fledged Next.js project is set up.
